# Machine-Learning-Models-Complexity-vs-Performance

In the first part of this project linear regression models of variuos degrees are generated and compared to determine which degree 
corresponds to a models that neither overfits or underfits data.

In the second part, classifiers such as Decision Tree and SVC with various regularization parameters are compared to determine which 
parameter values corresponds to a model with the best performance in classifying whether a mushroom is poisonous.
